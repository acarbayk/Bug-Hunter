# 🕵️‍♂️ Autonomous Bug Bounty Agent

**An AI-powered agent that autonomously scans codebases and web applications for security vulnerabilities using LLMs, reinforcement learning, and up-to-date CVE datasets.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is designed to help developers and security researchers automatically find vulnerabilities in their code and web apps. It leverages the latest AI models (OpenAI GPT-4), reinforcement learning, and public vulnerability datasets to provide actionable security insights.

---

## ✨ Features

- **LLM-based Code Scanning:** Uses GPT-4 (via LangChain) to analyze code for security issues.
- **Automated Web App Scanning:** Crawls and tests web apps for XSS, SQL Injection, and Open Redirects using Selenium.
- **CVE Dataset Integration:** (Planned) Fetches and integrates the latest CVEs from NVD.
- **RL-based Test Generation:** (Planned) Uses reinforcement learning to generate novel test cases.
- **Extensible Workflows:** (Planned) Orchestrate complex vulnerability detection pipelines.

## ⚡ Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bug-hunter.git
   cd bug-hunter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set your OpenAI API key:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
     ```

4. **Run the agent:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   - This will:
     - Fetch the latest CVEs (placeholder).
     - Scan the sample code in `sample_code/` for vulnerabilities.
     - Scan a local web app at `http://localhost:8000` (make sure something is running there).
     - Run RL-based test-case generation (placeholder).

## 📝 Usage Notes

- **Code Scanning:** Scans files with extensions `.py`, `.js`, `.java`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.rb`, `.php`.
- **Web Scanning:** Requires [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) installed and in your PATH.
- **API Key:** If no OpenAI API key is provided, the code scanner runs in mock mode (for demo/testing).
- **Sample Code:** The `sample_code/vuln.py` file is provided for demonstration.

## ⚠️ Ethical Notice

**Use this tool only on codebases and web apps you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.**
